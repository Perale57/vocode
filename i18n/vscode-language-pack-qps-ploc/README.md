# Pseudo Language Language Pack for VS Code

Adds localization for Pseudo Language to VS Code. Pseudo Language is a language used to test unicode character support in applications.

## Usage

You can override the default UI language by explicitly setting the VS Code display language using the **Configure Display Language** command.

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to bring up the **Command Palette** then start typing `display` to filter and display the **Configure Display Language** command.

Press `Enter` and a list of installed languages by locale is displayed, with the current locale highlighted. Select another `locale` to switch UI language.

See [Docs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=761051) for more information.
